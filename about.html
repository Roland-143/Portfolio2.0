                <p>
                    I am a Student at Purdue Northwest University studying Computer
                    Science with concentration in AI Studies, alongside a minor in
                    Cybersecurity. I enjoy coding, learning new technologies, and
                    working on exciting projects! Eager to apply academic knowledge and
                    real-world experience to contribute meaningfully and drive impactful
                    solutions.

                <p>
                    In my free time I enjoy to read, immersing myself in different forms
                    of literature, from fantasy to psychology and philosophy! I am an
                    avid hiker and traveller, and would love to find myself exploring
                    the world and experiencing new cultures. I enjoy disc golf and would
                    love to get back into Ice Hockey. Coding allows me to express my
                    creativity and problem-solving skills; I strive to build
                    applications that can make a difference in people's lives.
